## Database

This script will download and install all necessary packages and generate a PostgreSQL database called 'pmsdb', superuser: 'admin', password: 'bigai' and populate with 3 test users, one for each role.

### First time initialization:<br>
**Download the directory and run the following commands in a terminal:**<br>
`chmod u+x db_init`<br>
`./db_init`<br>

**If using WSL, run the following commands in a terminal (This will not install pgAdmin4):**<br>
`chmod u+x db_init_WSL`<br>
`./db_init_WSL`<br>

Follow the instructions and type 'y' when prompted.

The last step will require you to enter an email and a password. This is for pgAdmin4 (a graphical management tool for PostgreSQL databases), not for the database.

When finished, open your internet browser and go to http://127.0.0.1/pgadmin4/

1. Enter your email and password.
2. Click on 'Add New Server'.
3. Under 'General': put the name whatever you want (ex. PMS).
4. Under 'Connection': Host=localhost, Port=5432, Username=admin, Password=bigai
5. Check Save Password.
6. Save.

Now you are in.
On the left panel, expand the server<br> 'PMS' -> Databases -> pmsdb -> Schemas -> public -> Tables -> right click on abstractuser -> View/Edit Data -> All Rows.<br>
You should now be able to see the 3 test users.


**To connect to the database from terminal using psql, run the following command and enter the password '*bigai*' when prompted:**<br>
`psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -d pmsdb -U admin`

### Updating existing database:<br>
db_create will perform the same as db_init except it won't update system or install any additional packages.<br>
**Run the following commands:**<br>
`chmod u+x db_create`<br>
`./db_create`<br>

**ENUM datatypes:**<br>
You will find them at the top of the ddl file.<br>
